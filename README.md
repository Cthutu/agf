# ASCII GAME FRAMEWORK

AGF is a foundation for build ASCII style games.

## Building

There are 2 ways to build the executable.  One is via Visual Studio 2017, and another is via a batch file.  The
executables will be found in the folder `_bin/<platform>_<configuration>_agf`, where `<platform>` is currently `Win64` and `<configuration>` is either `Debug` or `Release`.

### Building via Visual Studio 2017

To build **agf.exe**:

* Run **gen.bat** to generate the solutions and projects inside the **_build** folder.
* Run **edit.bat** to run Visual Studio 2017 with the solution open.
* Use Visual Studio as normal to build either _Debug_ or _Release_ builds.

### Building via a batch file

To build **agf.exe** run **build.bat**.  This will set up your CLI environment ready for Visual Studio command line tools,
build the release version of **agf.exe** using _msbuild_.

## Cleaning

All files generated by the build are placed in folders that start with an underscore.  You can run **clean.bat**, which
will delete all those folders.

## Installation

The build environment provides a **install.bat** file that will copy the release version of **pl.exe** to the folder
determined by the environment variable **INSTALL_PATH**.  If **INSTALL_PATH** is not defined, the batch file will
warn you of this fact.  This folder should be included in your system's **PATH** variable so it can be found.
